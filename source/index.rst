Fuchsia Documentation
===================

Fuchsia is a light-weight toolkit targeting developers who build web applications in PHP. Its goal is to provide an environment in which nothing but what is used in your codebase per-request is loaded (lazy-loading). It enables developers to logically structure their code while enforcing some coding standards.
